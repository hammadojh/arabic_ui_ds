# 📱 Mobile UI Dataset Project

A research project aimed at building a comprehensive dataset of mobile application user interfaces. We're capturing UI elements, screens, flows, and interactions to create a valuable resource for UI/UX research and machine learning applications.

## 🎯 Project Overview

We're building a dataset that documents how mobile apps are built and used. Our focus areas:

🔍 Interface Components
📱 Screen Layouts
🔄 Navigation Flows
👆 Interaction Patterns
🎨 Design Patterns

## 📊 Dataset Structure

| Component | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Applications | `apps.json` | Base dataset unit - contains app metadata, platform info, and categorization |
| Screens | `screens.json` | Individual app screens with type, visuals, and temporal data |
| UI Elements | `elements.json` | Interface components with position, size, and classification |
| User Flows | `flows.json` | Sequential user journeys with ordered steps |
| Interactions | `interactions.json` | User actions and their effects on the interface |

## 📸 Data Collection Guidelines

### Screen Captures
High-quality screen captures are essential for our dataset. Here's what we need:

* Resolution: 1080 x 1920px minimum
* Format: PNG files only
* Quality: Crystal clear, no overlays
* State: Default/rest state
* Content: Real content > placeholders

### ✍️ Element Annotation

Accurate element documentation helps build a reliable dataset:

1. Measure positions and dimensions precisely
2. Use our predefined element types
3. Map parent-child relationships
4. Document all interactive features

### 🔄 Flow Documentation

Good flow documentation tells a complete story:
